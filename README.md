# Master in Big Data Solutions Team 1

Welcome to the bts-mbds-precourse-team1 repository. In this README you will find all the information needed to start using this project to analyse the 'Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data'. In the section examples are some examples of things we found in the data set.

**The repository structure is still taking shape, be aware that the structure can change a lot in the coming days.**

# Project Description / Abstract

This project examines a collection of global temperature time series (monthly frequency) for major cities collected by Berkeley Earth from other primary sources.  Various trends and ...

# Dataset

For this project we have used following data: 'Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data' from https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/home. The website offers different data sets, the data set used in this project is: GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv which is available via the link below. 
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/home

The data set contains the following 7 columns:
* dt: date of the recording in the following format YYYY-MM-DD
* AverageTemperature: the average temperature in Celcius
* AverageTemperatureUncertainty: the uncertainty in the the previous measure (AverageTemperature)
* City: the city where the average temperature was meaured
* Country: the country where the average temperature was meaured
* Latitude: the latitude where the temperature was measured
* Longitude: the longitude where the temperature was measured
